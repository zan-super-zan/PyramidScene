# 🏔️ PyramidScene

Hi there! 👋 This is **PyramidScene**, a small project I’m working on as I learn about 3D graphics. It's a basic 3D pyramid scene where you can scale, rotate, and change the colors of the pyramid. Nothing fancy, but it's been a fun way to get hands-on with **OpenGL**.

## 🎨 What This Is
- **3D Pyramid**: A simple pyramid rendered in OpenGL.
- **Transformations**: You can scale, rotate, and move the pyramid around.
- **Coloring**: Change the color of the pyramid to whatever you like.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
This project uses a few libraries:
- **OpenGL 3.3**: For rendering.
- **GLFW**: For window management and input.
- **ImGui**: For the basic user interface.
- **GLM**: For math stuff (like matrices and vectors).
- **GLAD**: For loading OpenGL functions.
- **stb_image**: For loading textures.

## 📝 How to Build It

If you want to try building this project, here’s how:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/zan-super-zan/PyramidScene.git
   cd PyramidScene
   ```
2. **Generate project files**:
    You’ll need to run premake in cloned repo to generate the Visual Studio project files:
    ```
    vendor\premake\bin\release\premake5.exe vs2022
    ```
